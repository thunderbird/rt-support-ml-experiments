  "title": "June 2024.   CAN'T SEND ON THUNDERBIRD",
  "content": "<p>I can't SEND on Thunderbird as of Update to Version 115.12.1 on 6/19.  I was able to SEND on June 18th and left town for a week and when I came back could not Send.  That could be a coincidence.  Have Windows 11, with Defender Firewall and Security virus protection.  I have TB version 115.12.2 up to date.  I have checked with Spectrum for the correct configuration and currently I have as Description: SMTP Server  (on top line);  Server Name: <a href=\"http://Mail.brighthouse.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mail.brighthouse.com</a> and Port 465, No Authentication and SSL/TLS.  My User Name: e-mail address ends in  @tampabay.rr.com and that is the same as shown on incoming server.   </p><p>My husband just downloaded TB program on his Windows 8.1 which is my old computer that I've been running TB on for 15 years without a hitch!!  ''''<em><strong>And he also cannot SEND.''''</strong></em>  It's very frustrating - we've tried changing server settings since Spectrum uses not only Brighthouse (which is the one they say covers the <a href=\"http://Tampabay.rr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tampabay.rr.com</a> address) but they also use <a href=\"http://Mobil.charter.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mobil.charter.net</a> and also <a href=\"http://TWC.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">TWC.com</a>.  I've tried changing them up but nothing works.  I've tried changing Ports and anything I could change I did, but nothing works.  I did get a couple of error msgs but they didn't help.   Brighthouse timed out and another msg was saying that the email address I was sending as had to match the email address of the authentication and that didn't make sense as I have only had one address &amp; (typed correctly in all places).  I have called Spectrum more than once and asked for an upper level, however, they were no help at all saying they have no resp. for 3rd party etc.    I HOPE YOU CAN HELP SOLVE THIS MYSTERY.  Thank you!   </p><pre>Tabatha </pre>",

I have been in touch with Virgin Media, my service provider, and I can send emails when logged on to my account and not involving Thunderbird.

  "content": "<p>Hi, </p><p>I repaired my inbox yesterday.  I had many messages still in that inbox but after the repair I only see 5 messages.  I looked in the directory my profile points to for my email and can see a large Inbox file - but I also see a very small Inbox.msf file.  It is almost like the process of rebuilding is pointing to another Inbox file.  See the picture attached. </p><p>I even tried to take a previous copy of the Inbox.msf file from a backup (it was 800 kb).  I deleted the old Inbox.msf file and replaced with the larger 800 kb file.  When I opened Thunderbird, it started to something:  \"Building summary file for inbox\" and about a minute later those same 5 emails show - instead of the full Inbox I would have expected. </p><p>Is there anyway I can re-associate the Inbox.msf file process rebuild/repair to the correct Inbox file (the one that is 737 meg in this case)?  I sure would like to get my inbox messages back (and file them away i/o leaving them there vulnerable to this kind of problem in the future). </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Patrick </p>",

Tools &gt; Import select Import From Outlook and the following message appears. “Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client can not fulfil the message request”. I’m taken back to the Import from screen with the addition of a red panel with “No Profile Found” on it. Outlook 2003 is the default e-mail client, checked more than once. I’m trying to migrate to thunderbird so I have no account setting, thinking they would be imported. My pst’s files have been moved to a directory on a different partition to the Outlook programme, tried creating a dummy profile using default Outlook storage and still fails. I’ve looked at converting pst files to mbox, but this doesn’t see to include the account settings. But I could add them manually or I can not import the mbox files or directory structure into Thunderbird. I’ve been messing around trying other things but nothing works. Internet searches, Thunderbird forum searches suggests solutions but all fails and the steps don’t match Thunderbird menu, etc in many cases. I’m stuck. Can anyone give any advice on how to migrate from Outlook 2003 to Thunderbird. Tools, Add-Ins or manual methods, anything just to get me up and running. PS I’ve two pst files, one is the default main Outlook.pst and the second a secondary store I created in the folders of Outlokk called Store.pst, beside the none default storage location everything else is standard for Outlook and Thunderbird. </p>",

  "content": "<p>I have two problems tha occur when using the Unified Folder tree view.  </p><p>1) The view of Local Folders that appears in the Unified Folders view (which I use and require) has lost all subofolders except for Outbox. In particular, it does not show Sent Copies which is  folder I rely on.  </p><p>However, Sent copies and several other subfolders for Local Folders are visible in the All Folders View.   As a workaround, I am currently set the tree view to show both Unnified Folders and All Folders to have access to Sent Copies in local Folders...but this is a pain because it means I have to scroll far, far, down in an excessively long folder tree to find Local Folders/Sent copies.  </p><p>So the solution I'm seeking to number 1: Restore Sent Copies, and other normal subfolders, to the view of Local Folders that appears in the tree when the view is set to Unified Folders. (Closing TB, Deleting the Smart Folders from the Mail folder and re-starting TB  does not solve or have any effect on this problem. See my conjecture at end below).  </p><p>Second problem is: I'm seeing a big handful of duplicate emails showing up in the Unified Folder Sent folder.  I've cleared up most of this problem by deleting Smart Folders from the Mail Folder in the profile...but this repair fixes most, but still permits a handful of duplicates to remain, especially in the Sent folder. I have been running TB happily for maybe 10 years. Current setup is  Windows 10 on a Lenovo desktop....my two mail accounts are Hotmail and Gmail.  </p><p>I'd be very grateful for assistance with these problems.  </p><p>My conjecture about these problems:  They arose in past month while there were a lot of starts and stops and edits of settings for TB in past couple months in order to keep TB connecting to Hotmail.  That finally got solved a week or so gao... but my conjecture is that some program crashes thar arose while editing TB sedttings may have contributed --at least to the missing subfolders n the main or Unified view of Local Folders. </p>",

Plenty of RAM and plenty of free disk space. </p><p>Here are the two issues... </p><p>1. More often than not, when an email comes into one of the inboxes and I am viewing the unified inbox there are two copies of the same email.

This is very aggravating and when you start trying the delete emails from the unified inbox it gets all hosed up and I end up having to go to each individual mailbox to delete the messages.  </p><p>2. This somewhat relates to issue one... Sometimes when an email is deleted from the unified inbox, a blank record remains like in the image. This shows only one but sometimes there are multiple ones. Of course, if I go to that message's inbox it is not there. </p><p>I have tried all the common things like deleting the index files to let the indexes rebuild, comparing folders etc., and again, this has been a persistent problem since day one.

Recently cox transitioned to <a href=\"http://yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">yahoo.com</a> with their email and users had to transition over.  I was able to do this for 5 accounts - no problem.  My <a href=\"http://hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">hotmail.com</a> was a bit more of a challenge but I was able to get it to work.  Last week I started getting sign-in errors.  Nothing worked and I deleted my <a href=\"http://hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">hotmail.com</a> address in Thunderbird figuring it would be better to just start over - wrong choice.  Now I cannot even install my <a href=\"http://hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">hotmail.com</a> account on my Thunderbird. </p><p>I first tried the straightforward approach.  Get an app password from my Microsoft account.  Nest I it account actions, add email account.  I added my name, email address and app password.  When I hit ok a message quickly flashed saying configuration doesn't work.  When I done I get a message that server already exists.  I tried going to manual configuration and changed to normal password but got the message again that server exists.  I went to the Outgoing server (SMTP) list but the outlook server doesn't show up.I tried using the hotmail password instead og the app password with same results.  Finally I logged out of Thunderbird, turned off the two party requirement in Outlook and again tried to add the account to Thunderbird.  Now I get the message 'could not get issuer fot oauth2 authentication'.  I next went into manual configuration, turned authentication to 'normal password' the the hotmail account installed. </p><p>I closed Thunderbird and started again.  sent a message to the hotmail account and had to reenter the password - works.  Tried to send a message and was asked againgn for the app password - then it works.  So all is good except when I check the server settings for smtp and IMAP, ot shows 'normal password'  After strugglig for two hours I do not want to risk  changing them to oauth2.  Checked under 'saved logins' and the app password is shown.  Is it likely that I have arrived at a stable solution? What am I risking by having the 'normal password' authentication? </p>",

  "title": "Problem with outgoing server SMTP ; cannot send emails",
  "content": "<p>Hi, our company is using a program called Visma Administration 1000 as economy system. Since we have macbook computers we thus have a Microsoft Remote Desktop downloaded, since the economy system only works through Windows! Anyhow, we then use Thunderbird as a local e-mail which is connected to the economy system, and through which we can send our orders, invoices etc to our email. However, ever since a few weeks back a troubleshooting messege has occured making us unable to send the emails; referring to a problem with the outgoing SMTP server. However, after speaking with an IT Support guy who looked it thorugh he said that everything looked like it should. BUT I am wondering if it might have anything to do with the server/thunderbird being blocked by the program, which I don't know how to check... Does anyone know how to fix it? </p><p>The error message is in swedish but translates to: \"The message could not be sent. The message could not be sent because the connection to the outgoing server (<a href=\"http://smtp01.binero.se\" rel=\"nofollow\">smtp01.binero.se</a>) failed. The server may be unavailable or is denying connection to the outgoing server (SMTP). Please check that your outgoing server (SMTP) settings are correct and try again.\" </p><p>I really appreciate any help I can get!! Thank you in advance, kind regards  Ella </p>",

  "content": "<p>I recently discovered that the content -- text, images, attachments -- of all of the emails in my Thunderbird Inbox, going back several years, with the exception of those I have received since July 2, 2024, have vanished. The header fields remained -- \"From\", \"Subject\", etc. -- but the content pane for each email is a total blank. So I right-clicked on the Inbox folder, then \"Properties\", then \"Repair Folder\", and the result was that Thunderbird then deleted even the header fields of those thousands of emails from before July 2, 2024. So now, there's no trace of them, not even the header fields. Before July 2, 2024, there were more than 9,200 emails in the Inbox folder. Now (July 9, 2024) there are just over 100. Fortunately, none of the other folders seem to have been affected -- only the Inbox. So all the emails I transferred to those folders over more than 25 years are still there. Does anyone have a clue as to why Thunderbird would randomly delete almost everything in my Inbox, yet leave the contents of all the other folders intact (even the \"Sent\" folder)? Did Thunderbird do an automatic update on July 2, 2024 that may have caused this disaster? Is there any way I can get those emails back? I use a desktop PC running Windows 10. Thank you. </p>",

This file has been imported and visible with the same file name and the quantity of the 30,044 emails sign. However, the contents are not shown up after we click the file through Thunderbird. The contents were actually popped up a few days ago and currently are not visible at all. Please explain this happening and let us know how to manage these contents to check. 2. Even though we make these MBOX files imported in the Thunderbird program, we couldn't make sure that it is possibly open to see since it has disappeared in the program as said in a 1st question. We currently have this MBOX mail in the computer and would like to keep it in an external hard drive to open this file to see in the future. We wonder if it is possible to import anytime and on any device if they download the Thunderbird program and have the same MBOX file.   3. We are not familiar with the MBOX format, and Google didn't let us export the whole quantity of the 64GB emails (there are missing emails in specific beginning periods which are not able to be seen as the same as the emails at the Gmail account). We would like to know if we could trust this MBOX and Thunderbird program with no more missing emails.  </p><p>We might need to make a call to discuss more about the program and the file after checking your response. </p><p>Thank you.

I'm using one of ESET's security products which, after scans, find malicious content in the INBOX file, located locally on the device under the path %APPDATA%%RoamingThunderbirdProfiles(_Name_Of_the_profile)_Imapmail(_Name_of_mail)_INBOX(mail123). Unfortunately, the security product is unable to get rid of the dangerous file, but only gives information that something bad is in the email.  When trying to find a specific email, I unfortunately run into a lot of problems. 1. the name of the email - in this case \"mail123\" does not exist in the thunderbird application itself. If I understand correctly, thunderbird itself chooses names for individual mails and then packs them in the INBOX file. 2. it is possible to correlate the email name from the INBOX file to the actual name(subject) of the email using other software such as MailStoreHome by importing the entire email profile (_Name_of_the_profile). 3. once the email is already correlated and found in MailStoreHome, I should be able to find the same email in Thunderbird (as I have imported the INBOX file, which is located locally, and which Thunderbird itself reads). Well, unfortunately no. Such an email in the Thunderbird mailbox (I already know the subject, content, date, etc.) does not exist. </p><p>And here comes my question. Is it possible to open the INBOX file itself and then find the unfortunate email and delete it? </p>",

  "content": "<p>How do I reply to an email when i have selected it in the inbox and I can read the email in the preview window? As far as I can tell there is no reply button anywhere.  I did double click on the message and suddenly about 30 tabs opened up with each tab having a reply button, which is very nice if I wanted to answer all 30 replies individually.  Now I have to open every email to reply and close 20-60 tabs just to reply, which I won't put up with just because of the nuisance bur for sure because of arthritis. </p><p>Note:   Someone recommended thunderbird to me as very useful but without a reply button in the inbox this is not really a usefull email program.  This seems like a minimum common sense basic email function. If you are going to force people to double click on an email in order to reply, it would common sense to only open up that email and not all 30-60 other emails in the string as one will want to reply to the latest email and not to all other emails in the string.  If people want to open up all the emails (I can't think that are very many people that want that), make that option a triple click.   Right now I have to do an extra click for a reply (compared to any other email software I have ever used) and I have to close 20-60 tabs just to reply to the latest email message, this makes thunderbird a waste of time.   I can't imagine I am the only one that considers these two issues basic common sense in email software.  Maybe most people just delete thunderbird as I was planning on doing without commenting. </p>",

Then when I tried to send or receive emails I got messages saying that the authentication I used was not supported. I tried every option available in the lists and got the same rejection.

(??) I tried using a command prompt according to a Mozilla help site but that didn’t work either. </p><p>The message from MS that TB would be able to function might be so if I could only log into TB, but I don’t have a PP.

However if I try to get the autofill to work by starting the names of the actual address books Thunderbird doesn't recognize the address books. Also, if I make a new address book and add names to it it will not be recognized with autofill. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I regularly send to the recipients of the address books. Thanks James </p>",

  "content": "<p>Happy to see thunderbird is doing better and better recent years. I think it is now the time to add an option to allow it automatically startup in the background on system startup, which has been asked for several years. That is a really useful option, why not just implement it? </p><p>I think there are 2 ways: 1. Just automatically startup in the background on system startup and receive messages 2. Register a service in the background to receive e-mails and pop up notifications, and in this case, we don't need to add this option </p><p>The first solution may be easier to implement, but the second seems better? Anyway, thunderbird should have one of them </p><p>BTW, add an option to minimalize when click on 'close' button. I know there's an extension for this, so why not just integrate it&nbsp;:-) </p><p>Thanks! </p>",

  "title": "How can I copy emails from one profile and add them to emails on another profile. (IMAP)",
  "content": "<p>This should be a simple issue but I've been struggling for ages. I changed email host and have a backup of my profile taken before the changeover, which caused my (IMAP) emails to disappear. But I have that backup profile.  That one I've called 'Profiles - old' and placed in in the same folder  (&gt;&gt;&gt;Roaming&gt;Thunderbird ) as the new one, called simply 'Profiles'. Only Profiles is read but I  can use oneor the other by swapping the names around. There are emails in that Old profile that I want to copy to the new one without losing what's already there.   As I say, this ought to be a simple matter, and it probably is, but so far I've waded through reams of online instructions that I've found to be either inapplicable or more less unfathomably techie and not come up with a solution. Help would be much appreciated! </p>",

  "content": "<p>I dual boot Win10 and Zorin Linux 17.1, and run Tbird on both of them, works great!  </p><p>I copied my profile directory from Win10 to Zorin, and then renamed it to the name of the profile directory that the Tbird installation on Zorin had chosen. So both systems access the same 10 IMAP email accounts. I keep messages locally, so the profile uses a fair bit of disk space on both systems. </p><p>In fact, the profile originally came from a different Win10 machine, so I had to copy it to a (large) thumb drive. And that took several hours and encountered numerous problems. The structure and content of the profile directory tree is bewildering. But despite the errors that caused a few thousand items (of the 302,000) not to get copied, it seemed to work just fine(!). </p><p>It turns out that Zorin seems able to read and write NTFS filesystems quite well. So now I'm wondering if I can copy the profile directory from Zorin to the Win10 partition on the same machine, and replace it with a symlink to that NTFS directory? Does Tbird do funky low-level things to the profile that might not work as expected with Zorin accessing it on NTFS? There would be no risk of race conditions since only one system can be booted at a time. It's just the problems I had copying to the thumb drive in the first place that make me worry that Tbird does some kind of magic with the profile that might not work with linux accessing NTFS... </p><p>I guess I'll go ahead and try it (and report back here), but I'm wondering if I should expect problems.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",

Po kliknięciu na wiadomość pokazują się nagłówki. Problem raz na jakiś czas pojawia się u mnie w firmie na różnych stanowiskach. Edytując plik folderu wiadomości zauważyłem, że koniec linii jest zapisany w CRCRLF, zamiast CRLF. Naprawa folderu z poziomu Thunderbirda nic nie pomagała. Rozwiązaniem okazało się usunięcie nadmiarowego znacznika nowej linii CR - napisałem sobie program do tego celu, który udostępnię w sieci, ale fajnie by było, aby ta funkcja naprawy była w samym Thunderbirdzie. </p><p>pozdrawiam </p>",

After fuming about that idiocy for a while, I canceled the process and imported everything from my old profile. </p><p>It fouled up mightily on the passwords, but I got past that obstacle course. </p><p>Now, I see that my \"Today Pane\" is empty.  Looking at the calendar, I see why:  Thunderbird apparently <em>pretended</em> to import three calendars, but skipped all but two old events.  I can create more empty calendars, but that is incredibly unhelpful.  One calendar is local.  One is an online ICS file published by an organization.  And the third (the one that had two events picked up) is subscribed to an OwnCloud account's calendar, and may have worked.  The first is obviously the most important, since I'd rather not spend time working out the database schema so that I can manually input every single event and appointment. </p><p>What hoops do I need to jump through to refill my calendar?  I'm running on Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, with the Thunderbird Flatpak (commit c2e09fc595198cf5c467ddad1fab56c0be512758584e16c3b933f2410968306a according to the command-line, if that gives any clues) installed.  And again, I feel like that setup used a significantly later version of Thunderbird recently, so figuring out how to undo Flatpak's decision to downgrade would also presumably solve the problem. </p>",

Existe também o termo “extra”, que é usado como um papel secundário no filme com poucos personagens. Isso é diferente do papel principal, que está se tornando cada vez mais importante. Como ator, deve-se ter o talento de atuação correspondente ao tema do filme em que desempenha o papel principal. Em algumas cenas, o papel do ator pode ser substituído por um dublê ou dublê. A presença de atores substitutos é importante para substituir atores que interpretam cenas difíceis e extremas, normalmente comuns em filmes de ação. </p><p>Os filmes também podem ser usados ​​para transmitir certas informações sobre o produtor do filme. Algumas indústrias também usam filmes para transmitir e representar seus símbolos e cultura. A produção de filmes também é uma forma de expressão visual, pensamentos, ideias, conceitos, sentimentos e emoções em filmes. Os filmes em si são em sua maioria fictícios, embora alguns sejam baseados em histórias reais ou histórias reais. </p><p>Existem também documentários com imagens originais e reais ou filmes biográficos que contam a história de uma personagem. Existem muitos outros tipos populares de filmes, incluindo filmes de ação, filmes de terror, comédias, filmes românticos, filmes de fantasia, thrillers, filmes de drama, filmes de ficção científica, filmes policiais, documentários, etc. </p><p>Estas são algumas informações sobre filmes ou a definição de filmes. Essas informações foram citadas de várias fontes e referências. Espero que seja util. </p><p>Seu primeiro programa de TV foi experimental, esporádico e, desde a década de 1930, só pode ser assistido bem perto do mastro. Programas de TV, como os Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 1936 na Alemanha, onde o rei George VI foi coroado. No Reino Unido em 19340 e com o lançamento do famoso David Sarnoff na Feira Mundial de Nova York em 1939, esse meio continuou a se desenvolver, mas a Segunda Guerra Mundial paralisou seu desenvolvimento após a guerra. O filme mundial de 19440 inspirou muitos americanos, e eles compraram a primeira televisão. Em 1948, a popular estação de rádio Texaco Theatre tornou-se o primeiro programa de variedades semanal da TV. O programa apresentava Milton Berle e recebeu o título de “Mr. TV”, provando que Este tipo de mídia é estável e pode atrair anunciantes em formas modernas de entretenimento . Em 4 de setembro de 1951, a primeira transmissão nacional de televisão ao vivo nos Estados Unidos, quando o presidente Harry Truman (Harry Truman) fez um discurso sobre o cabo transcontinental da AT&amp;T e o sistema de retransmissão de microondas no Tratado de Paz do Japão em São Francisco, ele já havia falado com o mercado local Empresa de radiodifusão. sim. </p><p>Em 1º de janeiro de 1954, a primeira apresentação nacional colorida (1954 Rose Parade Championship) foi realizada nos Estados Unidos. Nos dez anos seguintes, a maioria das transmissões da Internet e quase todas as transmissões locais continuaram a ser transmitidas em preto e branco. Anunciou a conversão de cores no outono de 1965, em que mais da metade dos programas do horário nobre da Internet são transmitidos em cores. Um ano depois, chegou a primeira temporada de pico de cores. Em 19402, o último suporte para o programa de rede diurno foi convertido na primeira temporada de rede colorida. </p><p>Veja também: Lista de gêneros § Formatos e gêneros de filmes e TV </p><p>Devido à variedade de formatos e tipos que podem ser apresentados, os programas de TV são mais diversificados do que a maioria das outras mídias. As apresentações podem ser ficcionais (como comédia e drama) ou não-ficção (como documentários, notícias e reality shows). Pode ser o mais recente (como programas de notícias locais e alguns filmes de TV) ou histórico (como muitos documentários e filmes de ficção). Eles podem ser educativos ou divertidos, assim como comédias episódicas e programas de jogos. [Citação necessária] </p><p>Os programas dramáticos geralmente consistem em uma série de atores que desempenham papéis em contextos históricos ou modernos. O plano segue suas vidas e aventuras. Antes da década de 1980, as performances (exceto para séries de novela) permaneciam estáticas em geral, não havia enredo e os personagens principais e premissas praticamente não mudaram. [Carece de fontes?] Se houver alguma mudança na vida dos personagens do episódio, geralmente é revertida no final. Portanto, os episódios podem ser transmitidos em qualquer ordem. [Carece de fontes?] Desde os anos 1980, muitos FILMS mudaram gradualmente sua trama, personagem, ou ambos. Por exemplo, Hill Street Blues e St. Elsewhere são os primeiros filmes dramáticos de TV de horário nobre com essa estrutura dramática nos Estados Unidos [4] [precisam de fontes melhores]. O último MOVIE Babylon 5 explicou ainda que essa estrutura tem uma história programada de cinco temporadas relacionadas ao plano. [Citação necessária] </p><p>Segundo relatos, em Black Widow, a televisão será responsável por uma proporção maior da receita das grandes empresas de mídia do que os filmes. Algumas pessoas também notaram que a qualidade de certos programas de TV melhorou. Em Black Widow, o cineasta vencedor do Oscar Steven Soderbergh anunciou a ambigüidade e complexidade dos personagens e narrativas: “Acho que essas qualidades podem ser vistas na TV agora, e quem quiser vê-las das pessoas está assistindo TV. </p><p>Aqui, você encontra todos os filmes que podem ser exibidos online, incluindo os filmes lançados nesta semana.

I have not installed any new software or made any major changes for several months.  I'm using Bitdefender Total Security.  Recently I started noticing this issue with Thunderbird (I've been using as long as it's been out.) </p><p>When composing a message, I now see on a regular basis at the lower left of the message window \"Assembling message.......\" or \"Assembling message......... Done\".  Thunderbird does not crash.  If I continue to compose and send, the message always sends.  So I'm not having the error some others have had in the past.  But it does look like the message I'm typing may be having issues being put into the Drafts folder while it's being composed.  That seems to be the only operation happening when the message appears. </p><p>I have seen this past week the messages sending and being placed into the Sent folder but there have been at least two messages identical to the ones sent that are still in Drafts and are not deleted after being sent.  So whatever is going on seems to be a bug with the saving of the draft and then cleaning out Drafts after the message is sent.  Note these are text only messages and I did not change any settings in Thunderbird after updating last week. </p><p>While Bitdefender updates on a regular basis and Thunderbird notifies me of updates when they are available (same with Firefox), those are the only items being updated so it seems something is going on.  I am going to assume this is an issue with Thunderbird for the time being since nothing else has changed.  I've gone through tips noted for those having errors sending messages when they get the Assembling message notification but I don't get any errors.  Just a weirdness with the Drafts folder. </p><p>In the interest of safety, I don't want to turn off AV to test anything.  I've also compacted folders to no avail.  Seems that notification keeps coming back. </p><p>Any additional help would be appreciated. </p>",

I did step 1 successfully, but unfortunately I'm stuck at step 2 because the Authetication method selector won't offer OAuth2 at all, as you can see here: <a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mrSstFtt/Captura.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://i.postimg.cc/mrSstFtt/Captura.png</a>. </p><p>1. What am I doing wrong? 2. How can I set my outgoing mail server to use OAuth2, then? 3. Do I need to anyway? </p><p>Hope you can give me a hand, so far this has been way more trouble than it needed to be. And after I sort it out I still need to do the same for K-9 on my phone -_-'. </p>",

Noticed a few things so wondering if someone can advise if this is just me, or normal behaviour... </p><p>In the global search, I finally realised (i think anyway) that it does not actually search everywhere, far from it. For instance, I searched for emails many times and it said they don't exist, so i panicked thinking they were lost, but no, I dived into Deleted Items and there they were. I store deleted items for 3 months, and often refer back to them for past purchase receipts or similar in the rare occasion that I need it again for some reason. </p><p>- It doesn't seem to search (doesn't find anyway) in my Imap Deleted Items folder,.  OR the Local Folders </p><p>- It isn't searching/finding emails in my Local Folderrs, which is a HUGE problem as 95% of my email is stored in those. Why wouldn't a global search find stuff in my local folders? I have tested it and confirmed it's not searching in any of them. </p><p>- I have ebay messages in my INBOX, from a username starting with perrie134 - I tried BOTH the quick filter and the CTRL K search, searching for 'perrie134' and then 'perr' and ZERO messages come up. Does the search not include 'from' info? </p><p>As far as I can tell, the search is not working at all. So I am hoping something must surely be wrong my end, but grateful if someone can comment. I can't use a program that can't find emails when I type in information included in 'from' and 'subject' areas, but at this point it's failing in every way. </p><p>Appreciate any advice/thoughts.

My concern is that Microsoft is saying that they don't want people using passwords and I'm not sure that I can continue doing what I'm doing today and still use Outlook 365. </p><p>I have an <a href=\"http://Outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outlook.com</a> email address and I have a second email account from a totally different provider.  I forward all of my <a href=\"http://outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">outlook.com</a> email to this second, alternative email account however I do not use the alternative email accounts SMTP server to send my mail.  I instead have my SMTP settings in Outlook 365 to use Outlooks SMTP server.  I do this just in case someone decides to look at the email's header information so it the outbound information in the header does not expose the email address of my second alternative email account.  Doing this pretty much ensures that I get very little spam as <a href=\"http://outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">outlook.com</a> scans it before it gets forwarded and my alternative account scans all forwarded email a second time before it appears in my inbox.  So to be perfectly clear my inbound pop server settings are configured for my alternative email address and my SMTP settings are configured to use <a href=\"http://Outlook.Com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outlook.Com</a>'s SMTP server. </p><p>Getting down to the heart of the problem Microsoft says that soon I will no longer be able to use my password with their SMTP server and they indicated that Thunderbird could be configured to use OAuth2 instead and they even provided an screen shot of the setup.  Unfortunately, Outlook 365 does not provide the ability to configure the SMTP server to use OAuth2 so this is why I would like to know from a Thunderbird expert if it can be configured with different inbound and outbound server settings and that I can use OAuth2 instead of passwords. </p>",

However, when I marked the email I was reading in the preview pane, all the emails before and after it were marked as read.  Even weirder, after manually marking a group of emails as unread, after a while, I sat and watched those emails get marked as read (un-bold) and then marked as unread again (bold).

A senior forum member told me that this problem was known, but that nobody was looking into it. Now to my problem: According to their help pages for Thunderbird, you can search partial expressions and complete expressions in the global search. To do this, you put the complete expression in inverted commas. I have tried this several times with different expressions. Unfortunately, no matter whether with or without inverted commas, only the partial expression is searched for. Example: \"D-Link\" Thunderbird searches for Link and not for D-Link. I have also restarted the search indexing. Unfortunately without any improvement. So my question is: are you aware of the problem? If so, are you endeavouring to rectify the error? If so, when? </p><p>with kind regards Jürgen Huber </p>",

I right click on each to Mark - Mark not as junk and yet over the days of use they are still being sent to that junk folder. As an exampl the ones from Meta are receipts for virtual games bought from their store. Several days back I marked those as not junk, the header of the mail rarely changes, but still they are being sent to my junk folder. </p><p>Within Outlook, on line, those mails are meant to be diverted to my Meta folder. If I was to go back to using Outlook, avoided opening it for quite some time now, I would expect to find those mails within that folder, and the Amazon ones within a Amazon folder. That is due to rules created for their placement within such  folders. </p><p>I guess my question is two part..... </p><p>why do such mails seem to persist in being marked as spam..? Secondly is there a ways to ensure they end up in their intended folders..? </p><p>by right clicking on them now they ar ethe nsent to my general inbox, including the BBC type. </p><p>Is there no such thing as a safe senders list tha tcan include omains and indivudal people / companies etc..? </p><p>Many thanks </p>",

How can I hide it? - Performance is worse: The update of the mailing list and the spam filtering is significantly slower than before. Often takes a second for 2-3 items.

  "content": "<p>and I immediately began scrambling to get it back. I found this somewhere: \"Don't Delete Files\" is the preferred option because it saves the old profile's folder and allows you to recover the files to a new profile. So that gave me hope because that's what I had clicked (unfortunately, it was right before I saw the cancel button over on the right). That's what I get for being in a hurry I guess. </p><p>Anyhow, after 4 days of reading support forums and tons of trial and error, I'm no closer to restoring that profile than when I first started (although I've learned a lot about what does NOT work). </p><p>Btw, both my profiles have always been set up as POP3 at Gmail, although if I ever get this current problem sorted out I'll be shopping for a different POP3 provider. But that's another story.    </p><p>I know how to create a new profile with Profile Manager. And I found the Profiles folders under both Thunderbird folder as well as ThunderbirdOLD folder. Have I been on the right track so far? </p><p>In the Thunderbird/Profiles folder, I don't see a folder with the deleted profile name (except the new ones (duds) I've since created ). On the other hand, I don't see the name of the profile that I did NOT delete either, but somehow it seems to be working just fine. Maybe it's the \".default\" folder or \".default-release\" folder? I've only ever had two profiles and I may have created the non-deleted profile first, so did that one end up being named .default? -shrug- I have no clue. </p><p>Anyhow, in the ThunderbirdOLD/Profiles folder, I also see \".default\" as well as \".default-release\" folders too. But in addition, I'm seeing a \".deletedprofile\" named folder. So that's where I originally thought my several dozen email folders with several thousand emails and Address Book etc are hiding. But I've copied all the above mentioned folders into the several new Profiles I've created, on a trial and error basis but so far..... no luck. All I get when I open one is the new set up screen to set up a new pop3 account.... which I can do, but that's just starting from scratch without any of my saved data. I'm running out of ideas. </p><p>Where am I going wrong? </p>",

  "title": "IMAP email on Thunderbird with Virginmedia login failing-DNS issue+App Password +VPN",
  "content": "<p>First off, this is an answer I wanted to share rather than a request for help. Spent significant time over the weekend helping family/friends with Virgin Media account and Thunderbird [Version 115.13.0 (64-bit)] on Win10. Virgin Media have introduced app passwords recently and all was fine until a recent update of Thunderbird. Ever since the account has refused to connect to the IMAP server. Other accounts with similar authentication methods worked but this one failed. </p><p>Issue Reproduction&nbsp;:  System&nbsp;: Win10, Thunderbird 115.13.0, Norton VPN running </p><p>1. Have Thunderbird configured with the virginmedia account (by the time it worked we had removed the app password from the Thunderbird saved passwords) 2. Select the VirginMedia account INBOX in the left hand window of Thunderbird 3. Click on the download (Get) new message button (cloud with the down arrow, top left of Thunderbird) 4. Thunderbird then says it is connecting to the IMAP server (bottom of mail window), waits a while, then the message disappears and nothing happens. No new messages download, no request for the account password, no error messages, just nothing. 5. On trying to send mail there is no request for the password the system just refuses to connect to the SMTP server.   </p><p>I had checked a few things on the cmd line and found that the DNS resolution of the virginmedia IMAP server was failing on lookup every time. Below is incorrect: Non-authoritative answer: Name:    <a href=\"http://imap.virginmedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">imap.virginmedia.com</a> Address:  10.100.10.100 </p><p>With the VPN turned off, the following was the result&nbsp;: Non-authoritative answer: Name:    imap-virginmedia-com.edge.unified.services Address:  84.116.6.19 Aliases:  <a href=\"http://imap.virginmedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">imap.virginmedia.com</a> </p> <ul><li>Turned the VPN back on again after running the [nslookup <a href=\"http://imap.virginmedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">imap.virginmedia.com</a>] command* </li></ul> <p>This is the solution, I found that worked for this instance. But as mentioned I spent significant time search for answer in the settings on Tbird and looking online for ideas. There was nothing that specifically reference this but a couple of ideas lead me to this.  </p><p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> 1. Start Thunderbird, go to the <strong>Tools Menu</strong>, then <strong>Settings </strong>and select it   2. In the new tab/window that opens select <strong>General</strong> on the left hand side, then scroll down to <strong>Network and Disk space</strong> 3. Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> button next to <em>Configure how Thunderbird connects to the Internet</em> 4. Scroll down the '<em>Connection Settings </em>window that opens, to the bottom of the page 5. Tick the box next to <strong>Enable DNS over HTTPS</strong> (I left the <strong>Use Provider</strong> set to <strong>Custom</strong> and the <strong>Custom</strong> field blank) then Click the <strong>OK</strong> button.  Make sure you click ok, don't just close the window. 6. Then I did a restart of Thunderbird (probably not necessary but just to make sure changes had propagated through the system). 7. Then repeated the download of new messages request with the VirginMedia account, was then prompted for the app password, which I re-entered and marked to save. New messages were then downloaded to the system. 8. Composed a new message and sent it, re-entering the password &amp; marking save it, again (as separate entries in the password table for IMAP &amp; SMTP). New message was sent successfully, copied to the sent folder and received correctly at the destination. </p><p>As mentioned, caveats&nbsp;: I don't work for Mozilla, I am a user like you, this worked for this system. I have taken the time to type this out in the hope it helps someone else, as I couldn't find this exact solution on the forums I searched.    Thanks </p>",

At some point while suffering with this condition it will 'just fix itself' and work sometimes for months or years then do it all over again.  I have tried over the years to fix it myself and have read &amp; tried every suggested solution that can be found.  I can open my emails in AOL, click on any link and have it open in Firefox.  This leads me to believe the problem is with T-bird and not any settings in my browser but just in case I have examined settings in both apps and not found a cause or solution.  I have tried every suggested fix in 'config' and have even removed and reinstalled T-bird three different times over the years but to no avail.  I really hate having to start over with a new installation especially since it doesn't fix the problem but has caused no end of headaches trying to retrieve my address book and re-customize my email program back to how I like it.

  "content": "<p>Hi all, </p><p>Im looking to only use thunderbird to open emails without access to any other parts of the application. Literally double click an .eml file within windows and get it to open the email and block all access to everything else, including (sorry!) the donation page which causes a browser window to open and we cannot have that (am happy to donate some money if I can block this) as well as the account start up. </p><p>So according to the documentation, I just need a policies.json file in a distribution folder, in the program files, thunderbird folder which I have done. </p><p>A very shortened JSON copy of this file is as follows: (includes one option that DOES work and one that does not) { </p><pre> \"policies\": {    \"BlockAboutAccounts\": true, </pre> <p>\t\"BlockAboutConfig\": true, \"Preferences\": { </p><pre>     \"app.use_without_mail_account\": {        \"Value\": true,        \"Status\": \"user\"      } </pre> <p>} } } </p><p>So that works on blocking the about config, but still allows Thunderbird to keep asking for a user account, unless specifying that you do not want to. This happens every time, unless set not to manually. </p><p>When setting the change, the prefs.js file within the profile that it creates has the value key name, and the value is the default of \"false\" unless the config is manually edited and switched off, then it changes to true. </p><p>There are no group policies set against Thunderbird so I have no idea why my policies.json \"appears\" to be getting ignored, though the BlockAboutConfig <strong>does</strong> work. Perhaps it is not Preferences that it goes against but something else&nbsp;? (something I was not able to find out in the documentation, but I could not see it). </p><p>Any help would be most appreciated but ideally we need: No main app window to appear (so just the email itself would appear) No account request No donation page to appear. </p><p>Am happy to contribute some money towards the project if this can be locked down. </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;! </p><p>Carl </p>",

I don't care if it can't find a writable calendar, I want to download the .ics file. Where is the .ics file? I can download it from the other two clients and then import it into Thunderbird calendar fine. But that's a complete pain in the neck, having to log into a seperate email client to do that.

  "content": "<p>Having downloaded TB version 128, the details for TbSync via add-on manager states that it is not compatible with this version. My questions, as a first timer with TB are: </p><p>1. Can I still go ahead and use TbSync with version 128? I need it to get contacts and calendar from <a href=\"http://Outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outlook.com</a> </p><p>2. Will the planned native support in 128 for Exchange ActiveSync allow for easy switch from TbSync? </p><p>3. I thought I would download TB 115 which TbSync works with, but all download buttons seem to point to 128 and I can't for the life of me find the actual download link for TB 115. </p><p>Thank you.
