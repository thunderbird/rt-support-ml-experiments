Is that possible?  One inbox for mail A, but sent as mail A or mail B with each own SMTP.  </p><p>Case: </p> <ol><li> Mail A has IMAP and SMTP access </li><li> Mail B has SMTP access </li><li> Mail A and mail B has different SMTP </li><li> Mail B has no IMAP/POP access but all email received are forwarded to Mail A </li></ol> <p>Purpose: Send email like normal (choose one click sender, then write the rest of mail) using email with only SMTP access </p><p>It works well if they are on the same SMTP. As each account can only have one SMTP, I have to change SMTP manually to mail B after sending mail as mail A. It works for sending (by changing SMTP details) but not efficient. </p><p>Or maybe, is there a way to create send-only mail without inbox? </p><p>Thinks like Gmail feature...  In Gmail, <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">Send emails from a different address or alias</a> feature-like is probably what I'm looking for. Its alias can have its own unique SMTP setting, but only have one inbox.  </p><p>It works too, but want to setting this in Thunderbird if possible. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1573634;1573637;1573676;1573678;1573683;1573686;1573691;1573693;1573695;1573745;1573805;,omiyage,1680336511,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1409754,2023-13,2023-04-01
