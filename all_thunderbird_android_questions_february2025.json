Android security patch Jan 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve tried both the most recent stable version of the Android Thunderbird app as well as the beta version, both from the play store. Both successfully import from the desktop app using the QR code. At least the process seems to complete without any glitches and my two mailboxes show up on my phone.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m connecting to servers at Pair networks, which works from the Thunderbird desktop (Max OS, Sequoia 15.3). I have two mailboxes, both routed to the \"unified\" view.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m pretty sure the mail servers are running IMAP, but there\u0027s always room for doubt.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m assuming that the little circle of arrows in the menu for the unified view does a manual sync, although I reconfigured the polling for 15 minutes and waited significantly longer than that and still nothing.\r\n\r\nI can send e-mails from my gmail account and they arrive at the desktop app in short order but don\u0027t get to the Android app. I\u0027m assuming here that both the desktop and Android programs will get all emails...\r\n\r\nI am running BitDefender on my phone, although I\u0027ve tried disabling that and still nothing when doing a manual sync.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u0027t appear that I can send e-mail from my phone either.
