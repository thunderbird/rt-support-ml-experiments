  "question_content": "There is a persistent Thunderbird problem of empty junk folder showing 1 unread message https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1371351 refers.  While that is a quick fix it does not address the underlying cause.\r\nA general search for the problem suggests that  it also affects other email clients.  This suggests that the problem is either a problem with IMAP or if your service provider uses the Microsoft email service platform.  This problem therefore seems to be down to Microsoft. \r\nI am in this position myself and another I believe related problem is the slow housekeeping that occurs when creating, moving or deleting Thunderbird folders.  The fact that by closing Thunderbird and restarting usually fixes the problem suggests either Thunderbird is not reindexing its data very quickly or Microsoft is not very quick in publishing changes.\r\nI hope these observations point the way to a possible formal solution rather than head in sand let\u0027s ignore it solutions.  The  problem while not world ending it does create FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) for users.",

  "title": "Thunderbird seems to be failing to release/relinguish previously used disk for 5-6 outlook addresses via pop",
  "question_content": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI need some advice on my Thunderbird email system.\r\nThe problem(s) that I’m having are what’s frequently discussed with\r\nregard to Tbird “gulping” system drive storage, without frequent release.\r\n\r\nI have been reading most of the narratives from this complaint, but the\r\nproblem I’m having seems a lot different. So, I came here to explain\r\nmy observation(s), in hopes I could correct this issue.\r\n\r\n1. I am a long term Thunderbird POP3 user, since before the failures\r\n\tbegan related to signon security changes, before the\r\n\tTbird corrections were employed(figuratively rewritten).\r\n\tI left Tbird during that time, and now I’m back.\r\n2. So, like many others, my problem(s) arise from Tbird’s apparent\r\n\tfailure to relinquish storage areas, when unused.\r\n3. Right now, My W10 system drive(SSD) is setting at sitting at 122G.\r\n4. It should be \u003c100G, and it’s been as high as 13xG.\r\n5. But, through some magic, something seems to happen during a\r\n\tinactive period, that will magically trip this storage to\r\n\ta more reasonable value. I have seen this 122G drop\r\n\tto 102G, but not in a very long time.\r\n6. Beyond the fact that I’m stumped, I chose to write this narrative\r\n\tbecause my operations/experiences are significantly \r\n\tdifferent from others I’ve read.\r\n7. First, this is the only problem that I’m having with Tbird. Everything\r\n\tthat I perform operates flawlessly.\r\n8. And, probably even more noteworthy, is that I never maintain ANY\r\n\temail data inside Tbird. Barring absence, as soon as I\r\n\tdetermine email arrival, or any email changes, I simply\r\n\tmove that email to a system repository for archival. As\r\n\tsoon as this archival is complete, the email is deleted\r\n\tfrom it’s point of arrival. So, IOW, every time I close this\r\n\tsystem, Tbird will be completely empty of current mail.\r\n9. Additionally, I initially configured ALL email storage repository to\r\n\treside on another system removable drive.\r\n10. Prior to this note, I issued the compact request. I did see a 3.0MB,\r\n\tbut I’ve never seen anything above 0 MB before.\r\n11. Additional attempts as solving this storage release problem, has\r\n\twarranted my purchase of a software product that will\r\n\tallow me to “look” into the internal storage of Tbird and\r\n\tseveral competitors, to send this hidden data to other\r\n\trepositories. It’s a long story, but I needed the product\r\n\tto migrate email data, where only Print PDF was avail-\r\n\table.\r\n12. But, it’s been very helpful in identifying Tbird internal email data\r\n\tthat remains, despite the fact that I’d cleaned Tbird of\r\n\teverthing prior to my last review.\r\n13. And, another issue is that all the email data that external email\r\n\ttool identifies, is deeply hidden from my standard Tbird\r\n\tclient. The email data may be several/many days old,\r\n\teven though the related viewable email data had been\r\n\tarchived/deleted several days earlier.\r\n14. I mentioned that I have my email data re-positioned(#8) to external\r\n\tsystem repository drive for archival. This specification is\r\n\tissued in the “Local Directory” definition defined within\r\n\teach email target definition. From my long past experie-\r\n\tnces with Tbird, I learned that I could enter each of these\r\n\t“Local Directory” alternate repositories, and just simply\r\n\terase them of ALL email data.\r\n15. And, the next time Tbird was initialized, those “Local Directory”\r\n\trepositories would be rebuilt, clean. This will remove\r\n\tall email characteristics formerly present. And, the \r\n\tremote repositories(#11) will be built clean, and no\r\n\tlatent email data will remain. However, this is probably\r\n\tunavailable for the 99.99% of users that maintain email\r\n\ton/in the Tbird system.\r\n16. Tbird does, at some time, reorganize these repositories to regain\r\n\twasted drive space. I don’t know/understand just what\r\n\ttriggers this reorganization, and it never seems to “sync”\r\n\tthe complete unused storage available. Right now, my\r\n\tsystem drive(SSD) was up to 122GB. Some time during\r\n\tmy research, I noticed a drop to 111GB. But, if all empty\r\n\tdata was reorganized, it would be \u003c100GB. Of course,\r\n\twhen I describe these system drive totals, I’m referencing\r\n\tthe high limit of storage, including ALL installed software.\r\n\t(#5).\r\n17. The software product that I installed, to be used to move email data\r\n\tfrom an email client to a stationary repository, is known as\r\n\t“YOTA Email Migrator” – A product of by YOTA Software\r\n\tInc. https://duckduckgo.com/?t\u003dffab\u0026q\u003dyota+email+migrator\u0026atb\u003dv415-1\u0026ia\u003dweb\r\n18. I’m very sorry for my extensive narrative, but this is complicated, and\r\n\tcomplication needs words.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGary Walker -",

  "question_content": "Gotta say I\u0027m rather disappointed with the Mozilla support community forum here.  It seems very poorly set up, unless I\u0027m missing something. Perhaps I\u0027m just missing the forum formatting page here.\r\n\r\nThe post form starts with asking \"Which topic best describes your question\"  - well none of the ones offered.  e.g. this question is about support, and that doesn\u0027t fit a category.\r\n\r\nFor technically literate users, often questions and posts will have code snippets etc in them, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be formatting support beyond bold, italic, links and bulleted lists?  Is that right?  No markdown for code? \r\n    Code with four spaces leading - does that work?\r\n\r\n\u0027\u0027\u0027 three quotes separated text\r\n    fenced code block?\r\n    Does this work at all? \u0027\u0027\u0027\r\n\r\nNot seeing a preview your question button either, so one posts blindly without knowing if it\u0027s legible or not. \r\n\r\nWhen I\u0027ve tried to paste some detailed email header info in a question it was terribly displayed which can\u0027t help getting community analysis and input. \r\n\r\nThese aren\u0027t new features for community forums. One would think them standard.\r\n\r\nIs there a posting guide for this support forum that provides formatting info that I might be missing? \r\nIs there another support discussion page somewhere else - perhaps stackExchange is more active?",

  "question_content": "Thunderbird updated itself, and suddenly a new and much less helpful format appeared both for email (inbox, sent, etc.) and for Address Books. The current version is listed in \"Help,\" under \"About Thunderbird,\" as being 128.9.0esr (32-bit).\r\n\r\nNow email listings are on two lines---name/email address and subject---each enclosed in a box and separated from the email before and afterward by a space. Previously, each email was on one line with no separation one from the other, which made it much easier to run a visual search when looking for a specific email. Whatever advantages this new format are supposed to have are lost on me. They are not convenient for my purposes.\r\n\r\nAddress books are even more unhelpful in this new format. They, too, are two-line listings in boxes with space between. All that space is unnecessary and unhelpful, but the big negative here is that it no longer is possible to see listings in the categories that used to be selectable off to the right, such as (in my case) phone number(s), email address(es), and---critically---Organization and organization Title. These are absolutely vital for finding a listing when the name of the person can\u0027t be recalled and organization or title need to be scanned, but now only name and email address appear, crippling such an effort.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the work many do to sustain Thunderbird, but it would be very handy if those designing formats would take into account how information actually is used.\r\n\r\nThe big question: May I please get the old format back, or, failing that, is there some way to customize this new format to at least show organization and organization title in address books without having to click each individual listing? And if even this is not possible, how does a user use organization and organization title to search with?",

(Vertaald met DeepL)\r\n\r\nAls extra toevoeging aan mijn vraag.\r\nHeb Thunderbird voor desktop PC en Laptop Windows 10/11 eveneens geïnstalleerd, bij deze versie kun je de gekoppelde contacten zien en de eigenschappen raadplegen, zie afbeelding CardDAV URL.\r\nIndien ik dergelijke instellingen op de android tablet van mijn vrouw zou kunnen openen of raadplegen, met de werkwijze hoe ik de CardDAV URL link kan aanpassen naar de google contacten van mijn vrouw is mogelijks het probleem opgelost.\r\nEchter, in tegenstelling tot de desktopversie Windows, heb je bij de Android-versie niet de mogelijkheid om aan de linkerkant van het scherm te kiezen tussen e-mail, contacten, agenda, taken, chat, afbeelding.\r\n\r\nAlvast bij voorbaat bedankt voor jullie hulp en ondersteuning.\r\nMet vriendelijke groeten, Edwin",

I could try to add the OUTLOOK account on GMAIL via POP, but I want IMAP and GMAIL only allow for POP.\r\n\r\nSo, the feature request would be for ThunderMail to act not only as an email server/client as GMAIL, but also as a full email client with IMAP/POP, with special attention to the IMAP case which would take ThunderMail truly beyond GMAIL.",

  "question_content": "Hey,\r\nI\u0027ll try to keep this brief. Microsoft is forcing me to buy a new PC so as to \"upgrade\" from Windows 10 to Windows 11. My Windows 10 PC has Thunderbird (128.9.1--it says it\u0027s up to date) and it works just fine. I\u0027ve spent over two hours attempting to set up Thunderbird on my new Windows 11 PC and...no dice. I\u0027m at the end of my tether; I can\u0027t afford to waste more time on this. So...\r\n\r\n--Thunderbird 137.0.1 (fresh download this afternoon--unclear as to the discrepancy vs. Windows 10 ver.)\r\n--Email \u003d ATT\r\n--The setup program says it knows who ATT is and has the configuration\r\n--When I press \"Done\" for the setup to get everything going, it spins forever, then says, unhelpfully, \"Unable to login at server. Probably wrong configuration, username, or password.\"\r\n--Needless to say, I\u0027ve checked everything 48 ways from Sunday; let\u0027s assume that my email is correct\r\n--So if it\u0027s not my email address, that leaves password or configuration, right?\r\n--Password: According to Mr. Google\u0027s AI (*ahem*) I shouldn\u0027t use my regular password, I should use a \"secure mail key\"...well, that\u0027s okay, my regular password wasn\u0027t working anyway\r\n--Believe it or not, I\u0027ve got notes on my original secure mail key so I enter that. Doesn\u0027t work. I enter the random character string that the secure mail key is supposed to stand for. Doesn\u0027t work.\r\n--I generate a fresh secure mail key in case the silly things have a shelf life. The new one doesn\u0027t work, nor does its random character string.\r\n--I then direct my attention to the configuration. Thunderbird said it knew what to do, but...what if? Inbound looks okay, compared to the settings on my old PC and also as recommended by Mr. Google.\r\n--Outbound...uh, oh...\r\n----Old PC says Server Name: smtp.att.yahoo.com (this one\u0027s been working)\r\n----Thunderbird thinks its supposed to be: outbound.att.net (I think that\u0027s what it said...I\u0027ve got it set to something else at the moment)\r\n----Mr. Google says: smtp.mail.att.net\r\n----I think I tried another outgoing server address that I saw somewhere else, but at this point I\u0027m punch drunk and cannot remember for sure.\r\n\r\nFolks, I\u0027ve tried every permutation that I can think of for passwords and outgoing servers and, lacking any intelligent guidance as to exactly what the problem is, I have no idea what else to try.\r\n\r\nI\u0027d appreciate advice as to what to try next, but am no longer hopeful. I may have to move on to another program in an effort to get something that works. I\u0027m falling behind on my day.\r\n\r\nSpoiler alert: Don\u0027t tell me to curse at the screen or give it the middle finger...I\u0027ve already tried those approaches and they don\u0027t work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGrey",

  "question_content": "Today\u0027s announcement re Thundermail brings me back to an old gripe of mine - which doesn\u0027t bother me, but might one reason some new users are put off.\r\n\r\nMany email users are used to the full-fat reply header which they have been used to in Outlook and other email clients/webmails. (From/To/Subject/Date/CC etc)   When a new user first replies to an email, they will only get the basic Unix legacy \"On [date] [name] said:\"  This took me back when I first used TB, back at something like v7, but I soon found the Reply With Header add-on.  However, the existence of this add-on or even its name vs. function is not obvious, and a new user may simply find that the cut-down header does not meet their requirements and simply looks elsewhere for a client.  If the ReplyWithHeader add-on functionality ever disappeared, I would also be quitting TB (though finding an equally good program would be hard, but not impossible.)\r\n\r\nNow, the code to do the full reply header is already in TB, as it is placed into a Forward message.  So, as I see it, TB could very usefully (a) default to the full header for replies as well as forwards, and (b) include a simple long/short reply header option under Preferences - many mobile Apps already have this (Bluemail for example).  This would remove one possible negative experience for a new user.",

So recentIy I changed my email address from \u003cgnwalton@optusnet,com.au\u003e to \u003cgnwalton58@gmail.com\u003e and had Gmail read my optusnet account as another account to read.\r\n\r\nOptus are my \"carrier\" (my access to the internet) and have been ever since their inception many years ago. \r\n\r\n1.   Please look at Image 1 screen dump:     You can see from this that I have had various spasmodic entrances into Thunderbird, which I would now like to erase.    How?\r\n\r\n2.    Windows Live Mail had a feature where, while I believed it was downloading my INbox and SENT files from the Optus server or Internet, it also automatically saved these files to my own computer hard drive.     I was therefore able to attach a past file (perhaps years ago) to a current email as an attachment........without any archiving!     I have instructed Thunderbird to POP my files - which I believe is not allowing them to reside in the \"cloud\" - so that they now reside IN Thunderbird ON my computer?     Could you please confirm my beliefs,   or otherwise?\r\n\r\n3.     Perhaps all this info is contained somewhere is a separate file so I would appreciate your referral to such info and make life easy for you.\r\n\r\n4.    Perhaps I should also explain I am a retired octogenarian chemical engineer who has been interested in and solving process problems all my life!!     I\u0027m just naturally curious!\r\n\r\nKind regards,         Geoff Walton           Melbourne, Australia",

I then used the repair folder and when Thunderbird restarted, my inbox message are all gone, about 20 of them.

If so what is the best way to accomplish this?  In addition how do i get the archive folders to show up on my e-mail accounts.  If this is not the correct forum, please let me know so I can correct this!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMM",

  "question_content": "My question: is there a way to force a light TB theme and use white tab background text color?\r\n\r\nI installed a theme add-on which I like except the associated dark theme.  I want to use the theme image with a light TB theme but it appears the tab background text color determines the theme color (light or dark).  This image has some darker colors and a light/white tab text looks the best, but this color seems to force a dark theme for the rest of TB (White text -\u003edark theme).  If I change the manifest file to use a different tab background text color I can change the overall theme to light or dark.  Using a darker or black tab background text color the theme changes to a light theme.  Light tab background text color changes to a dark theme and darker tab background text colors forces a light them. I\u0027m guessing there is a threshold 1/2 way between black and white text that will force the theme one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe articles I have read on this json file don\u0027t provide any examples and this is as far as I have been able to get.

Hoping this doesn\u0027t have a simple answer that I can\u0027t find on my own, but I have looked and haven\u0027t found anything yet.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been using Thunderbird for a while to manage all my email accounts. But the layout started doing something weird this morning that makes it almost unusable for me. I noticed this about 11:45 in the morning and it had been working normally until that moment all morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I open Thunderbird with layout set to Classic View, the \"Welcome to Thunderbird\" page is visible normally in the bottom of the screen. When I click on an email to open it, the email usually appears on top of this welcome page so I still have almost half the vertical screen space for reading my emails. I typically use the F8 key to turn this pane on and off.\r\n\r\nToday, it seems that the emails started only taking up about a quarter of that space. Between the list of emails and the pane where I read the emails, the \"Welcome to Thunderbird\" page  remains partly visible, taking up screen space. I only have a little bit of the email visible. It remains this way no matter which layout I change to. Did I press a button that changed this accidentally? I can\u0027t see why anyone would want this sort of layout.\r\n\r\nI have screen shots to help you see what is happening. The first one shows what Thunderbird looks like when I first open it. That appears normal. The 2nd image shows what happens when I try to open an email. As you can see, the Welcome page is now occupying a big part of the screen and there\u0027s barely any space to read emails. I can\u0027t adjust it with the mouse. How can I remove this?",

  "question_content": "I am running Thunderbird 115.18.0 (64-bit) on Linux Mint 21.3 Virginia (base: Ubuntu 22.04 jammy). My goal is to create an offline copy of a 13 GB gmail account in local folders and then delete all the custom IMAP folders to regain some free space in gmail storage.\r\n\r\nI am achieving this by:\r\n1) Setting up an IMAP account in Thunderbird for the gmail account.\r\n2) Enabling local storage of all folders (in Settings and set config flag, etc). Changed gmail settings to unlimit the number of IMAP downloads. Set Thunderbird account concurrent connections to 15 (gmail max).\r\na) Edit/Preferences/Advanced/General/Config Editor: mail.server.default.check_all_folders_for_new \u003d true\r\n3) Click on each IMAP folder in Thunderbird to initiate download of that folder. I don\u0027t see this documented anywhere but it doesn\u0027t seem to download the messages in each folder until I do this.\r\n4) Turn Thunderbird offline and ask it to download all emails before going offline.\r\n5) Copy all folders from the gmail account in thunderbird to local storage.\r\n6) Turn Thunderbird back online.\r\n6) Delete custom IMAP folders in Thunderbird gmail account to clean up gmail online storage.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, step 2 should be enough to force a download of all emails in all IMAP folders. I added steps 3 and 4 because it\u0027s unclear when this process is complete. Especially given gmail IMAP bandwidth limits: https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl\u003den \r\n\r\nMy questions relates to step 3 and 4. In step 3, I don\u0027t really have any way to know when Thunderbird has finished downloading all emails from all the gmail IMAP folders. I\u0027m experiencing the typical gmail login issues and throttling due to too many concurrent connections and given this it could take days if Thunderbird can even keep track of which messages downloaded and which got errors back from gmail.\r\n\r\nHow do I know when Thunderbird has finished downloading messages prior to going offline? Does it notify me with a dialog or do I just have to keep hovering over the Offline toggle periodically until it actually says offline?\r\n\r\nAny constructive tips on how to confirm everything is downloaded or process improvements, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\npi",

  "question_content": "Hello. I want to remain in body text - that is, with no double spacing of paragraphs - when I compose e-mails. I have done a good bit of searching and the answer I keep finding is \"Uncheck the \u0027Use paragraph format instead of body text\u0027 box in Composition on the Options tab.\" The problem is that every time I close and re-open Thunderbird, the option has been automatically re-checked. \r\nThis happens even if I uncheck the box, close the program, and then immediately re-open it without having written an e-mail or done anything else. So this has nothing to do with importing formatting by responding to an existing e-mail.\r\nI found the corresponding setting in the Config Editor and set it to False, but the same thing happens: It defaults back to True as soon as I re-open Thunderbird. \r\nIs there something I can do to keep that \"Use paragraph formatting\" option turned off?  \r\n\r\nI am using Thunderbird version 68.12.1, 64 bit.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.",

Our IMAP accounts have no problems. I CAN send emails, and the new messages do show on the web portal. My phone can also receive messages. on my PC TB tries for about 10 minutes to get the messages, then shows an error message \"The DELE command did not succeed, error marking a message as deleted. Mail server pop.mail.yahoo.com responded too many requests\". For a couple of weeks I found some messages never downloaded (most did) but now I get none. Interestingly today when it happened I would hear the audio announcement for the account there was mail, but none showed. Server settings are what is specified, tried restarting in Troubleshoot mode to no effect, and updated TB to next version. Still stuck.  Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\np.s. Just to complicate more, Windows did an update dated April 8, installed sometime on April 9.\r\n\r\nSolution found:\r\nI found a year-old backup of my TB profile and replaced the existing one with it (after first copying the existing one for safety). That worked, except ALL messages were downloaded again. It appears every time TB tried to access messages it started at the beginning, so there were multiple copies of each old one to delete. A small price to pay for getting TB back online. So the problem was a corrupted profile, reason unknown.",

  "title": "Thunderbird times out with smtp.outlook365.com",
  "question_content": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have what appears to be a common issue, but the common solutions I found don\u0027t seem to help. \r\n\r\nI migrated to a new Mac[1], and my Thunderbird[2] on Mac times out while sending messages through the SMTP outlook server. So I am unable to send emails from account.  By migrating, I mean I copied over my entire ~/Library/Thunderbird and used that. It actually did work for a few days.  But then it started failing.\r\n\r\nThere are some common suggestions on the internet for how to fix this, and I have tried them all:\r\n* make sure correct settings are used. I am using Outgoing SMTP Server: smtp.office365.com, port: 587, security: STARTTLS, authentication: OAuth2.\r\n* make sure Firewall is disabled\r\n* restart Thunderbird\r\n* restart Mac\r\n* delete Thunderbird folder in Library, and just start over with a new profile.  \r\n* change Thunderbird time out setting\r\n* check that I can send email from Mac Mail - yes, this works.  It must  a difference between Thunderbird and Mac Mail that causes the issue. \r\n\r\nThe error I get, after about 15 seconds is: \"Send Message Error. Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to the Outgoing server (SMTP) smtp.office365.com timed out. Try again.\" \r\n\r\nI have no problem receiving email, but am unable to send.\r\n\r\n I tried gomtp to look at what was happening, but I wasn\u0027t sure how to configure the ssl, tls, auth settings and how to specify where to find the password.  \r\n\r\n[1] Mac M4 Pro running Sequoia 15.3.1\r\n[2] Thunderbird 137.0.1 (aarch 64)",

I have a ton of email that I need to save and be able to access through Thunderbird again.

The problem is that it copies in some moves/copies the messages in an order that I am unable to comprehend, hence the folder move keeps getting interrupted with the same error. Is there an option in the settings/configurations that can be used to force TB to continue copying/moving even if it encounters an error? I got around this using the ImportExportNG extension, that did not stop the transfer if it encountered an error, but I had to export the folders through the extension before importing them. I\u0027m now working on a nested directory, and I am hesitant to use the export/import option to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nErrors like this appear often: \"The current command did not succeed.

  "question_content": "Please excuse the fact you could fit what I know about email setup on the head of a pin with a lot of room left over. A long time ago I set up Thunderbird to connect to my gmail accounts. I was a broker before I retired recently and wanted a more professional looking email address so I configured something (do NOT remember how I did it) so that when I emailed someone or someone responded to my \u0027callmoss@gmail.com\u0027 address using the pseudonym \u0027Ben@callmoss.com\u0027 it would be recognized by both gmail and by Thunderbird and arrive as if it had been sent to the actual \u0027callmoss@gmail.com\u0027 address. A lot of changes have been being made at Thunderbird but suddenly around 2/26/2025, all my email sent to Ben@callmoss.com stopped arriving and were bounced back. If it\u0027s a gmail problem, I\u0027m screwed because I will never be able to contact a Google (Alphabet) human being as that is flat out impossible by phone, mail, email or any other communication known to man or gawd. However, if it\u0027s a Thunderbird adjustment that can be made, you guys are always great about helping users out. If you have an idea what I am talking about and can suggest a solution, I would really appreciate it. That email was my main one and a lot of people must be wondering why I suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth. Thanks so much!\r\nBen Alter\r\nrichlandrealestate@gmail.com\r\nbeenaltered@gmail.com\r\ncallmoss@gmail.com",

  "title": "Trying to Install Thunderbird , with Hotmail , it says \"Too Many Requests\" for Login Live",
  "question_content": "I\u0027m trying to set up Thunderbird since Microstupid decided to stop Windows 10 Mail , I am on Version 21H2 Windows 10 , (its several years old , but the Feature Updates after that one slow my PC\u0027s down to about half speed and cause constant blue screens  , so I found a program that shuts off Windows Feature Updates but the cost is , I can\u0027t download anything that goes through the Microsoft Store because it says I need to Update Windows  , not going to happen  , so I have to find a email program that lets me install it without needing a Windows Update to continue .. so here I am)\r\n\r\nWhen setting it up it wanted my email , which are Hotmail accounts (I have 2 of them I need to set up) , so when I entered the requested info it wants my Password  , so I enter it and it takes me to a Live Login window , where it gives a error saying Too Many Requests  , I have no idea what that means and why it gives the error and no explanation how to fix it  , I did a search here but it says 0 results for that inquiry , so I can\u0027t go any further  , I am currently using Outlook(PWA) so I have it on my Taskbar , but it sucks , and for some reason I can only set up 1 email account so I can\u0027t get my other emails from my other Hotmail account  \r\n\r\nBoth my accounts go through Microsoft and both use the same Password , so its going to be a issue setting up either of them if I can\u0027t get my Password entered without a error because its going to give the same error if I set up the other account , also the \"Server\" is going through Office 365 and I do not use that , so not sure how to manually configure the incoming and outgoing server for Pop 3 (I think that is what Hotmail uses), its been so many years since I had to do that manually I forgot  , but I think that is the problem , is its going through Office 365 and I uninstalled that along with Outlook Classic because it wanted me to pay for it at the last second after installing it , all because some 12 year old at Microstupid wants my PC to act like a Cell Phone while claiming Windows Mail is a Security Risk when I have never been hacked and have used it or some form of it since Windows 95 but they just shut down my email without even telling me they were doing it  , its complete BS and Microsoft should be sued and/or FORCED to put it back the way it was , just for the stress they caused \r\n\r\nAnd I have not found a email that is the same as Windows 10 Mail that doesn\u0027t require me to Update Windows to install it , even though the programs are not part of Microsoft , so I\u0027m hoping this functions like it , but I can\u0027t get it to complete the setup to find out , and I HOPE all my emails and Contacts just transfer over automatically , because I sure don\u0027t want to do that manually\r\n\r\nAnyway  , How do I get past that Error ??  , I am thinking it has to do with it using Office 365 for the Server , which I know was never the old way to do it (back in Windows 95-XP) it used some other Server setup which is what I \"think\" is the conflict\r\n\r\nAlso hopefully this works with 21H2 version of Windows because I\u0027m not going to Update it after having to Reformat about 6 times because of the stupid Feature Updates my other PC is a sluggish mess because I updated it and so I just shut it off till I can Reformat it , it takes about a month to get my PC back where it was before , every time I have to do that and I usually end up losing something along the way that won\u0027t work anymore , so I won\u0027t do it again\r\n\r\nAny helpful info/guidance would be appreciated ....

It appears to create a new index file: It creates another one with a different suffix: Inbox-MacBookPro-2.msf -- the same size as the Inbox.msf.  So far so good...\r\n\r\nIn the new computer Thunderbird I can see the Inbox and all the Local folders. However, when I attempt to look at an email, I select an email, and the pane below the email is solid white. I see no text. (see screenshot below)\r\nI generally run in Dark Mode. And on the settings page \"Enable dark message mode\" is checked, and \"Show dark message mode toggle\" is also checked (but I have no idea where to find the toggle!).\r\n\r\nHow do I get Thunderbird to display a selected message? (if it is only black text on white background that\u0027s fine ... or if it can be white text on a black background -- dark mode -- that would be better). But right now I can\u0027t see the message text, period!",

Will this data overwrite all the contents in my inbox and basically revert the inbox to an older state? Or will my inbox be crammed with doubles?\u0027\u0027\u0027\r\n\r\nSince I use IMAP, any changes to the messages in Thunderbird will sync to the mail server, so I really don\u0027t want to do anything that deletes things or makes a mess on the mail server.\r\n\r\nOf course, it can be good to have a copy of my messages if the mail server crashes, but if I only need to transfer data to a new PC or restore my data after a computer crash, I would rather just download the up-to-date inbox contents from the server. At the same time, it\u0027s important to me to make this backup since I want to be able to transfer my settings and local folders.\r\n\r\n\u0027\u0027\u0027In this case, should I remove some files in the backed up profile folder before the transfer? If so, which files?\u0027\u0027\u0027 The folder structure and content of the subfolders \"Mail\" and \"ImapMail\" aren\u0027t very intuitive, with various subfolders and multiple files named \"Inbox\" of various sizes.\r\n\r\nAppreciating any clarifications on the matter and help to avoid conflicts between copied/backed up profiles and my current inbox.",

  "question_content": "TB 137.0.1 (64-bit)\r\nEdition\tWindows 11 Pro\r\nVersion\t24H2\r\nOS build\t26100.3775\r\nExperience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.66.0\r\n\r\nWas repeatedly encountering \"Cannot read summary file\" when opening TB. Some research indicated this issue goes back many years and can be intermittent. After much \"repair folder\" the issues seems to have abated. However, as part of my research I explored the user-local filesystem tree for TB for one of the larger email accounts I monitor, as in\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\user_name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles\\\u003c8_chars_profile_id\u003e.default\\ImapMail\\\u003cmail_server_name\u003e\\email_top_level_folder_names_as_NTFS_directory_names.\r\n\r\nFrom this I discovered that with a Message Store Type of File-per-folder, TB constructs a filesystem directory tree that replicates the email folder tree, including the naming, presented by the IMAP email server. Not an unreasonable design choice but one with a potential flaw. Given that a Windows user_name can be 20 characters, an FQDN hostname can be 253 characters, and the max IMAP folder name length can be uncertain but apparently good practice is no more than 250 characters,...\r\n\r\n* What happens when TB goes to create a deep-in-tree directory having a pathname that exceeds the Windows maximum of 260 bytes? \r\n\r\n* Suppose this deep-in-tree directory is not originated from the TB UI but rather from a TB update scan of an IMAP server? \r\n\r\nThe user could have created IMAP folders via a Web interface with longish names in a 3 or 4 deep hierarchy not understanding the total pathname length limit in how TB echos the IMAP folder tree with a directory tree. The user then points TB at this email account and oops. Does TB fall over?\r\n\r\nThe default leading part of the TB AppData pathname above could be 93 characters alone before we get to the email server FQDN. Windows 11 Pro does offer a Group Policy setting to enable long pathnames up to 32k for manifested apps but this policy is not configured OOB.\r\n\r\nRegards.",

It now seems to have a minuscule amount of instinctual usability. \r\nMy question / statement is where is the Tutorial. Like many products including Microsoft, make what they think are brilliant \"improvements,\" and what they primarily do is cause confusion, frustration, greater difficulty in using the product and for many a wish they fervently pray for: \"I I want my old thingamajg back.\"\r\n\r\nI hadn\u0027t used Thunderbird since February of 2024 - LAST YEAR. Currently it is unrecognizable from then. I had  been hospitalized with 3 stents, a pacemaker and heart valve, I\u0027m back functioning and love life. However - It would have been simple to make a dozen short tutorials on enough things to easily do the basics. Pleading for donations and not making it simpler to use the product doesn\u0027t attract new users \u0026 make current users happier. I would be grateful if anyone can point me to some simple tutorial. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion what Thunderbird offers is too cryptic for me to process, I hope my post is noticed by a \"Solver\" Don\u0027t misunderstand me. I liked using Thunderbird for these many years because it was incredibly flexible, usable, and partially simple \u0026 instinctive. Today few people have the will or time to spend hours poring through help sheets that are a challenge and confusing to use.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate your help.",

Nor did message filters.  \r\nThen I saw a post where they said to go up 3 levels from the profiles folder and copy all that.  Is that right?\r\nBut it also says the local folders should be under local/thunderbird instead of roaming/mozilla thunderbird.  And I don\u0027t see any mailbox folders there.\r\n\r\nAlso supposedly you are supposed to be able to go to a command window and type thunderbird -P \"profile\" to open a specific one, but when I do that it doesn\u0027t show me the profile names, just default, default-esr, and default-esr1.  But I have multiple profiles on my computer so I am unable to choose the different ones.  \r\n\r\nSeaching through past posts is sometimes not useful because they refer to old versions of TB.\r\n\r\nA few more details:\r\nI loaded TB fresh on a new computer and ended up with 2 profiles.

One of the 2 on the old computer contains local folders I\u0027ve never been able to figure out how to bring back into my current profile, instead of having to go into that profile when I want to look at local folders.  (I did that because Thunderbird performance was really suffering with large local folders, but I\u0027m hoping that problem is solved now.  What I would like to do is combine all the local folders from the 2 old profiles into one and make that the active one on my new computer.  I\u0027m sure there is a way I can move the local message files, I remember doing this many years ago, but the file extensions changed since then and I need to know which ones to move.    \r\nTHANKS!",

(If I start firefox snap from the command line, the firefox icon shows the \"running\" indicator under it as it is supposed to.\r\n\r\nNote:  Thunderbird IS running and running fine - I have not found any other issues, just this potential regression.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas?  I thought I would post here before filing a bugzilla bug report.  I was not able to find any mention of this (or a similar) problem in the last year.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

I used this with “Thunderbird” until recently basically without any problems.  However, during 2024 I started to get many scam email problems.  Late in 2024, the bank with which I have my bank accounts here, recommend that I cease using the Zimbra suite and transfer all my dealing with them to a Gmail account as they feared that I would probably be hacked.  I have done that but problems remain with it.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago this got worse and I got over 200 emails for LIME\u0027s (now named FLOW) Billpay system advising of overdue accounts, none of which were mine.  I have reported this to FLOW but that have given me no assistance.  I understand that they intend phasing out use of the Zimbra suite.\r\n\r\nCurrently, both the Zimbra and Gmail accounts are integrated into Thunderbird on my system.\r\n\r\nMy question is, can I remove the Zimbra suite completely and incorporate this into my Gmail account?\r\n\r\nCan you please assist on this?",

The following is a log entry from such a failing for a \"magazine\" entry for \"Aeon\".\r\n\r\n [4/25/25, 12:35:15 GMT-4] Applied filter \"Aeon magazine\" to message from Aeon Weekly \u003csupport@aeon.co\u003e - This week: Why AI science will be incomprehensible at 4/25/25, 12:34:22 GMT-4 moved message id \u003d 89c6e02ebaf75bbc918731474.c3e7d573b0.20250425163412.c7ad5cda2b.7a1e170f@mail220.suw16.rsgsv.net to imap://mdalphin%40gmail.com@imap.gmail.com/Maillists/Aeon\r\n\r\n[4/25/25, 12:35:20 GMT-4] Filter action failed: \"Move failed\" with error code\u003d0x80550009 while attempting: Applied filter \"Aeon magazine\" to message from Aeon Weekly \u003csupport@aeon.co\u003e - This week: Why AI science will be incomprehensible at 4/25/25, 12:34:22 GMT-4 moved message id \u003d 89c6e02ebaf75bbc918731474.c3e7d573b0.20250425163412.c7ad5cda2b.7a1e170f@mail220.suw16.rsgsv.net to imap://mdalphin%40gmail.com@imap.gmail.com/Maillists/Aeon \r\n\r\nThe entry in msgFilterRules.dat reads as follows after the failure:\r\nname\u003d\"Aeon magazine\"\r\nenabled\u003d\"no\"\r\ntype\u003d\"17\"\r\naction\u003d\"Move to folder\"\r\nactionValue\u003d\"imap://mdalphin%40gmail.com@imap.gmail.com/Maillists/Aeon\"\r\ncondition\u003d\"AND (from,ends with,aeon.co)\"\r\n\r\nA \"diff\" from a saved version of the file that worked shows that it is identical except for \"enabled\".\r\n\r\nThis failure happens to 100% of my filters - the \"actionValue\" is not recognized as I move the file between hosts or different profiles. I need to re-select the desired folder in the drop-down list of \"Move to:\" in the \"Edit Filter\" dialog.\r\n\r\nAny idea on what is going wrong? It is as if there is some cache of recognized Imap folders that have unique IDs on a per host basis. Is there anyway I could make this copying work better without need to restore each of the 31 folders every time I make a copy?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMark",

  "question_content": "After almost three weeks of hacking I finally solved my [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1496304#answer-1722782|Hyperlinks are not working]] problem. (It was very difficult, including creating a new `https` setting and hand-editing the profile\u0027s `handlers.json` file.) So now I can finally open links in emails like I could in TB 102 before upgrading to 128. Since I have \"Always ask\" set, I get a dialog with a choice of which web browser to use. All good.\r\n\r\nProblem is that the browser dialog pops up a minimum of once per hour whether TB is open (not minimized/iconified) or not.  (I leave TB running at all times, often for months at a time.) This is annoying, particularly because the URLs are to internal TB infrastructure, usually but not always https://notifications.thunderbird.net/2.0/notifications.json.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do with these JSON links? Many don\u0027t even have a filename in the URL, so I can\u0027t save them in my profile folder even if I wanted to. If TB wants them as updates shouldn\u0027t it know where/what to do with them, and do it? I suppose I could turn off \"Always ask\", which I don\u0027t want to do -- would TB handle the URLs correctly then? Or would it just open the link in the default browser and I\u0027d be worse off than I am now? (I usually just \"Cancel\" the dialog and don\u0027t go to the URL.)\r\n\r\nIt would be even better if I could completely turn off all notifications, period. I always have \"Check for new messages every ... minutes\" turned off and manually check my POP/IMAP messages when I want to. I\u0027ll update TB when my Linux distro has a new version. In fact I\u0027ve always noticed  that TB runs continuously as a background process, adding a small percentage to a CPU core\u0027s usage. Is there any way to turn this off, too, so that TB is completely quiescent until un-mininized and \"Get Messages\" or \"New Message\", etc. is clicked?\r\n \r\nAny help appreciated. I\u0027ve used Thunderbird exclusively as my email client for over 20 years, and IMO these kinds of new features and the breakages they cause have made things continuously worse since the days when I used TB 68 and 78. BTW, I\u0027ve tried all the above in 115 and 137 with the same problems.",

  "question_content": "This is a usability feature request. If there is a better place to post this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThunderbird very cleverly adjusts the time of ICS events to the local timezone. That seems like an obvious best practice. The problem is that without actually displaying the timezone, that leaves the user guessing what timezone is being referenced. This can occur when traveling, when you may or may not have adjusted your timezone settings correctly, and further confusion is possible if calendar is not set to use the system timezone setting. Simply adding the timezone to the time display would provide an easy feedback to allow the user to recognize any local misconfiguration and otherwise remove any uncertainty about what time the sender actually intended.",

Never a problem with Tbird on desktop, but sending email from my laptop has always been sketchy with Charter/Spectrum; I\u0027ve fiddled with switching SMTP ports to allow sending from laptop and often succeeded (using suggestions from web: ports 587, default 465, and a few others).

Now I\u0027m unable to find a port on my laptop that the SMTP server won\u0027t block.\r\nMy suspicion is that the problem is caused by the simultaneous installations of Tbird on the laptop and desktop and the SMTP server won\u0027t accept mail sent from both when using the same ports. I was able to send a test email from my laptop while my desktop was being updated (and offline, obviously), but as soon as the desktop was updated I was no longer able to send from my laptop again (blocked SMTP server message).  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance to any users who have some good suggestions.",

  "question_content": "I am considering moving over and using thunderbird as a desktop email client principaly to archieve my emails per the advice in the book. The book advices from a privacy and sercuity perspective that a email clinet such as thunderbrid should only be used to archive emails and not to send them.  I dont think this is a big risk and I am considering using thinderbird to send emails as well, not just from a browser.\r\n\r\nAre you able to clarify and provide further insight on this ?  What are the privacy and security risks of sending an email this way ? Please see extracts from book below. \r\n\r\nI do not recommend using them for daily access to these services, or to send email messages, but only as an archiving solution to make sure you always have a copy of your data offline.\r\n\r\nI use this only as an offline backup of all email in the event I cannot access my Proton Mail account\r\nonline. I never send email from this application.\r\n\r\nA decade ago, my main concern about email privacy would have been exposure of a true IP address. Most of us\r\nstill used email clients which shared the local IP address within the email headers of every sent message. he\r\nrisk today is minimal. If you send an email from within a web browser through a service such as Proton Mail,\r\nTuta, Fastmail, Gmail, etc., the recipient should only see the IP address of the email server. Your true home IP\r\naddress should not be exposed. If you send an email from an email client while using these services, you are also usually protected. The emails bounce through the service provider\u0027s servers before going out and only includes those addresses. However, sending email through a client configured for corporate email may expose your true IP address. As an example, sending an email from your employer\u0027s provided address through a traditional emailclient from home could expose these sensitive details.",

On that day, I updated my Okta password, which also affected my Gmail account because Gmail is connected through Okta.\r\n\r\nSince then, my Thunderbird email client has stopped working.\r\nIt keeps asking me to allow Thunderbird to access Gmail, and even though I allowed it many times, the same pop-up keeps appearing.\r\nTo troubleshoot the issue, I have tried the following steps:\r\n\r\n* Reset my Okta password again to rule out any password issues. (I am able to log in to Gmail successfully with the new password and I can configure the same Gmail account with the Mac Mail app without any issue.)\r\n\r\n* Upgraded the Thunderbird client to version 137.0.2.\r\n\r\n* Cleared saved passwords and cleared cookies. (Note: \"Accept cookies from sites\" is enabled under Web Content settings.)\r\n\r\n* Deleted the account from Thunderbird and tried to re-add it.\r\nAfter this, I started getting the error:\r\n\"Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username, or password.\"\r\n\r\n* While adding the account, I entered my name and email address, left the password field blank, unchecked \"Remember Password\", and filled in the configuration manually.\r\nWhen I clicked on \"Re-test\", it detected the server settings correctly.\r\nBut when I clicked on \"Done\", I got the same error again.\r\n\r\n* Created a completely new profile in Thunderbird and tried again, but still faced the same issue:\r\n\"Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username, or password.\"\r\n\r\n* Uninstalled Thunderbird completely and reinstalled it, but the issue still remains. (Please refer to the attached screenshot.)\r\n\r\n* I tried the troubleshooting mode, which disables all the add-ons and themes, but the issue is still the same.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not sure if this is relevant, but Gmail has made some changes (see the link https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?visit_id\u003d638814378228955739-1844270273\u0026hl\u003den\u0026rd\u003d1).

The Thunderbird third party platform allows permanent offline archiving of emails, which I require for my work. Is Thunderbird aware of this major issue caused by an update via Google? Will there be a Thunderbird solution or workaround?\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\nDr. Dwayne Lepitzki, \r\nBanff, Alberta, Canada",

I have three POP3 email accounts that I access through Thunderbird, and all are missing.\r\n\r\nI have been selecting several different Help and Forum search returns to correct this issue, though none (that I can find) pertain directly to my specific problem.\r\n\r\nI am running Windows 10 64 bit and recently downloaded T-Bird. (Last 6 months, auto updating) Per the Information section, T-bird is running the 32 bit version.

My old profile still exists, and I have set my old profile as the default to no avail.\r\n\r\nWhile attempting to follow the instructions for copying my old profile to a separate drive and bringing it back, I noticed that both the \"Imapmail\" and \"Mail\" folders are missing from the root directory of the old profile. Doing a windows file search on the C drive, the only folders that appear on the drive are those of the new default profile created by T-bird after the power failure.\r\n\r\nLooking inside the \"Mail\" folder in the new default profile, I see that it contains everything from my old profile. I copied the folder and placed it in the old profile root directory to no avail, though I have not done a re-boot of the computer itself.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have not tried is deleting the the new profile after selecting the profile as default. I am afraid to delete anything, as in my mind I may permanently delete something if I did.\r\n\r\nHow do I get T-bird to return to it\u0027s proper function where all my accounts appear upon opening of T-bird?\r\n\r\nWhat is it looking at (points to) to retrieve each profile or the email accounts ?",

  "question_content": "Hi All.  Long time (25 years) user here, first time poster.  Just want to report weird issue/bug, thought to start here on the forum:\r\nI\u0027m a fast typer and often sending emails quite quickly.  When I click \u0027reply\u0027 to a message, for example, I start typing pretty shortly thereafter.  What I\u0027m seeing in the past month or two (sorry, don\u0027t have accurate info on when this started) is that the focus briefly jumps to the \u0027to\u0027 field of my message before jumping to the body (where I think it should be from the beginning).  The result is that I start typing my message (e.g. \"Hello Gloria, Thanks for your email ....\"), and get an auto-matched address from my address book (e.g. \"He\" matches to \"Henry Yu\") plugged in to the to: field.  Then the rest of the text continues in the body field.\r\n\r\nSometimes I notice, sometimes I don\u0027t (if there are multiple recipients in particular it\u0027s harder to notice the extra address).\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s obviously undesirable to be sending messages to basically randomly selected addresses from my address book.  Why is Thunderbird sending the focus to the to: field for a moment, and then jumping to the body?  I suggest just putting the focus squarely on the body.  Or, lock my keyboard or something until the message is ready to receive input.\r\n\r\nOr would anybody know a workaround to this?  Other than slowing down, which is of course what I\u0027m doing at the moment.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m on Windows, T-bird 128.9.2esr (64-bit).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nGeorge",

However, after doing so, performing the Archive action on an email in Thunderbird causes it to resubscribe to All Mail.\r\n\r\nMore generally, unsubscribing from the target of \"Other\" in the \"message archives\" setting for the account will cause the setting to be unspecified (i.e. point to \"Choose Folder\"), after which the Archive action seems to use the last-specified target, re-subscribing to it if currently unsubscribed.\r\n\r\n1. Is this the desired/expected behavior of the message archives settings?\r\n2.

  "question_content": "I believe I have noticed a change in the operation of Calendar Event notifications, following recent updates to Thunderbird, in the past week or more.  I am currently on release 137.0.2 (64-bit) running on a Linux Desktop.  This computer gets shut down every night, and rebooted the following morning.  When a calendar reminder has been snoozed, and the snooze time expires when the computer is not running, and Thunderbird is not running, those calendar reminders used to show up the next time Thunderbird was started after the computer was rebooted, even if the calendar event time had already passed.  In the last week or so, following recent updates, I believe this is no longer happening.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe that calendar events that have reminders set, that have not been snoozed, whose reminder time happens when the computer is shut down, are also not being shown reminders the next time the computer is started, if the reminder time happened when Thunderbird was not running.  This is also a change from the way it used to work.  For example, if an event is marked as starting at 10:00 AM, with a reminder set for 2 hours before (which would be 8 AM), and the computer is booted and Thunderbird is started at 8:30 AM, that reminder no longer happens.  That is a change from the way it used to work.  A few weeks ago, in that scenario, the reminder would have been shown the next time Thunderbird started up.",

Have exported several large .pst folders + sub-folders \u0027\u0027\u0027using third-party software\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027 into several corresponding .sbd folders.  \r\n\r\nSuccess in TB to point individually to each one of the .sbd folders with the Local Directory address, each shows the sub-folders and mail as expected in the Local Folders menu of TB.  However, the Local Directory address (Account Settings) seems to allow pointing only to a single folder with properly configured .sbd designation.  \r\n\r\nIf I point to the root folder containing several individual and properly configured .sbd folders, none are recognized.  \r\n\r\nThere is an Add-on called LocalFolders that would seem to solve this problem by allowing as many local folder locations as needed, but it\u0027s not compatible with current versions of TB.  I wonder if TB will embed a function allowing for more than one local folder address, or having it be smarter in recognizing compatible folders within a single directory location rather than directly pointing at an .sbd folder.  Adding new folders to Local Folders is not what is needed in this instance.",
