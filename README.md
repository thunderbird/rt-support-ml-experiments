Tell me how many posts are in each group. Make sure one of the groups is "authentication issues" and include anything that talks about being unable to get into their email account, a password issue, or some sort of connection error to a server that is likely to be authentication-related. Also, call out the total number of posts that mention "Microsoft" or "Google" at the end.  Please link to the posts using the "question_link" field in the JSON file.`

## 1. 2024-11-18 Create JSON file just for November 4-17, 2024 i.e. last two weeks
* Edit the file and delete anything before november 4, 2024, have to figure out how to do this using jq or mlr :-)
* file 2024-11-04-2024-11-17-yearly-thunderbird-questions-id-link-yyyymmdd-title-content.json
```bash
cp 2023-2024-yearly-thunderbird-questions-id-link-yyyymmdd-title-content.json 2024-11-04-2024-11-17-yearly-thunderbird-questions-id-link-yyyymmdd-title-content.json

```bash
./create-json-from-question-and-original-poster-answer.rb \
