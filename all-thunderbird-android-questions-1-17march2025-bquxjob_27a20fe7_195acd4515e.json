In the folder \"x\" and I use different addresses for every service I sign up to to avoid spam. This has all worked very well with k9 until recently - new emails were automatically shown, even if they were in new folders. But since a few days this doesn\u0027t work anymore, only the Inbox is synced, and I have discovered that there\u0027s an option to enable sync for every folder individually, which doesn\u0027t work for me, as I need the app to sync new folders (and I have too many folders already for it not to be annoying to enable everything manually).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

  "title": "MailChannels blocking ALL emails sent from Thunderbird for Android",
  "question_content": "Last week MailChannels began blocking ALL emails that I send from Thunderbird for Android.\r\n\r\nPrior to this I had no problems sending from Thunderbird for Android, but MailChannels claim the issue is that Thunderbird is creating malformed headers or message IDs.\r\n\r\nOther clients for Android are able to send mail without problems. Thunderbird for Windows is able to send mail without problems.\r\n\r\nLooking at the source of the headers in mail that fails and comparing with mail that is not blocked, the only differences I can see are that Thunderbird for Android is the only client creating messages IDs where the UUID part of the ID is capitalised - other clients use lower-case letters in the UUID. As far as I can tell either is legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe only other difference being the inclusion of the User-Agemt identifying the client as \"Thunderbird for Android\"..\r\n\r\nThe error message in MailChannels\u0027 bounce is as follows:\r\n\r\n550 5.7.1 [CS] Message blocked. If this is a false positive, please report this to your hosting service provider.\r\n\r\nThe reason for rejection given on the linked MailChannels page is that the message has been identified as spam content.\r\n\r\nI have contacted my hosting provider and after a lot of emails exchange (using Thunderbird for Windows!) they have simply said that the problem is with Thunderbird and that I should change my email client - no explanation of what they think is wrong with the headers!",
